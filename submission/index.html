			<h1>Paper Submission</h1>

			<p>Max Ent 2018 invites contributions on all aspects of probabilistic inference, including novel techniques and applications, and work that sheds new light on the foundations of inference. We welcome submissions by authors who are new to MaxEnt and on new and emerging topics.
